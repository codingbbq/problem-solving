/*
    Merge Sort
    - Divide and Conquer Algorithm
    - Recursive algorithm
    - Two phases - Splitting and Merging
    - Splitting leads to fast sorter during the merging phase
    - Splitting is logical, we do not create new Arrays.
    - Merging phase requires temporary array
    - O(nlogn) - base 2 - Logarithmic algorithm
