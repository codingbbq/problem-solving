// If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree
use BFS

// If the tree is very deep and solution are rare:
BFS (DFS will take long)

// If the tree is wide
DFS (BFS will need too much memory)

// If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
DFS

// Determining whether a path exists between two nodes
DFS

// Finding the shortest path
BFS
